Mammalia,Homo Sapiens
- has been a representative organism from the start of the study and has been
used as a reference
- a vertebrate organism that has all the 51 genes of the PG synthesis pathway
- an organism that lives on land 

Actinopterygii,Danio Rerio
= the zebrafish is an important organism for the study of PG and bone synthesis
- an organism that lives in water

Archelosauria,Anas Platyrhynchos Platyrhynchos
- mallard/dabbling duck
- clade proposed in 2014 for turtles and archosaurs (birds and crocodilians)
- 1000 ultra-conserved elements in genome that are unique relative to other
clades
- chosen organism lives on land and on water

Lepidosauria,Notechis Scutatus
- tiger snake
- reptile with overlapping scales

Amphibia,Xenopus Tropicalis
- western clawed frog
- amphibian that needs water, or a moist environment, to survive
- because of the moist environment requirement, it may be the case that PG
synthesis occurs differently (PG is highly negative and attracts water; since
water is not always abundant, maybe the pathway genes changed slightly)

Holocephali,Callorhinchus Milii
- australian ghostshark
- cartilagenous fish

Coelacanthiformes,Latimeria Chalumnae
- west indian ocean coelacanth
- vertebrate fish that is more closely related to lungfish, amphibians, 
reptiles, and mammals than common ray-finned fishes
- organism may be a good model for better understanding of the transition from
water to land

Hyperoartia,Petromyzon Marinus
- lamprey
- jawless fish
- devoid of mineralized skeleton, although traces of globular calcified 
cartilage may occur in the endoskeleton 

Hyperotreti,Eptatretus Burgeri
- inshore hagfish
- considered the most primitive living craniates
- considered sister-group to lampreys

Phlebobranchia,Ciona Intestinalis
- sea vase
- suborder of sea squirts
- primitive organism

Pterygota,Drosophila Melanogaster
- fruit fly
- important model organism for genetics

Rhabditina,Caenorhabditis Elegans
- nematode
- has an pseudoexoskeleton (cuticle/tough outer covering)
