# Proteoglycan pathway evolution analysis

### Description
A collection of files associated with a project I contributed to as as final-year Bioinformatics student at the 
University of Saskatchewan.    

### Summary
The group hypothesized that organisms that synthesize proteoglycan, as part of collagen production, exhibit higher 
non-synonymous vs. synonymous mutation ratios. There are 51 genes in the proteoglycan synthesizing pathway, which will 
be used as a starting point. Orthologs will be identified for the 51 genes, which will help the group identify 
organisms that are relevant for the study. The organisms will be grouped according to taxonomic information, such as 
species, and further sub-divided into organisms that (1) produce cartilage, (2) do not produce cartilage, (3) 
terrestrial, (4) non-terrestrial, and (5) organisms that have ancestors that made bone, but bone was lost secondarily. 
By comparing the non-synonymous vs. synonymous mutations in a pair- wise fashion, the group will be able to suggest 
potential biological conclusions regarding the evolution of the proteoglycan synthesizing pathway, such as whether the 
proteoglycan synthesizing pathway is selected for in organisms that produce collagen.
