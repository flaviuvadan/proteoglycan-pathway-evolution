# Proteoglycan pathway evolution analysis

### Description
A collection of files associated with a project I contributed to as as final-year Bioinformatics student at the 
University of Saskatchewan.    

### Abstract
Proteoglycans are a class of macromolecules comprised of proteins to which 
carbohydrate groups are attached. They serve important functions in the 
synthesis of cartilage as they bind collagen and are part of bone formation. 
In addition, proteoglycans are known to function as signal molecules as they 
are present both intracellularly and extracellularly. The loss of 
proteoglycans is associated with debilitating diseases such as osteoarthritis. 
Therefore, an enriched knowledge of proteoglycans may aid osteoarthritis 
research by suggesting significant genes of the pathway, which can become 
subjects for more detailed studies. This research focused on collecting 
*Homo sapiens* orthologs of the proteoglycan pathway genes. Data for this 
study were collected from Ensembl. Multiple sequence alignments were performed
 to investigate sequence conservation. Phylogenetic analyses and an 
investigation of non-synonymous vs. synonymous mutation ratios of proteoglycan
 synthesis genes were conducted with the intent of verifying whether organisms
 that synthesize bone and cartilage exhibit higher mutation ratios compared to
 organisms that do not synthesize bone and cartilage. Contrary to expectation,
 the research identified that organisms that synthesize bone and cartilage
 exhibit lower non-synonymous vs. synonymous mutation ratios compared to
 organism that do not synthesize bone and cartilage.
