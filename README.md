# Proteoglycan pathway evolution analysis

### Description
A collection of files associated with a project I contributed to as as final-year Bioinformatics student at the 
University of Saskatchewan.    

### Abstract
Proteoglycans are a class of macromolecules comprised of proteins to which 
carbohydrate groups are attached. They serve important functions in the 
synthesis of bone and cartilage. In addition, proteoglycans are known to 
function as extracellular signal molecules and have been identified 
intracellularly as well. The loss of proteoglycans is associated with 
debilitating diseases such as osteoarthritis. Therefore, an enriched knowledge
 of proteoglycans may aid osteoarthritis research by suggesting significant 
genes of the synthesis pathway, which can become subjects for more detailed 
studies. This research focused on collecting *Homo sapiens* orthologs 
of the proteoglycan synthesis pathway genes. Data for this study were 
collected from Ensembl. Multiple sequence alignments were performed to 
investigate gene sequence conservation across organisms. Phylogenetic analyses
 and an investigation of non-synonymous vs. synonymous mutation ratios of 
proteoglycan synthesis genes were conducted with the intent of verifying 
whether organisms that synthesize bone and cartilage exhibit higher mutation 
ratios compared to organisms that do not synthesize bone and cartilage. 
Organisms that synthesize bone and cartilage were hypothesized to showcase 
higher non-synonymous vs. synonymous mutation ratios compared to organisms
 that do not as a consequence of evolutionary pressures caused by
 environmental factors, such as the transition from water to land. Contrary 
to expectation, the research identified that organisms that synthesize bone 
and cartilage exhibit lower non-synonymous vs. synonymous mutation ratios 
compared to organism that do not synthesize bone and cartilage.
